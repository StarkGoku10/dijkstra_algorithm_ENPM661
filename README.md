To run the code:

1. Install openCV.
   It is used for map building, constructing and configuring the map and visualizing the obstacle space and implementation of dijkstra algorihtm

2. Clone "https://github.com/StarkGoku10/dijkstra_algorithm_ENPM661.git" and navigate to Dijkstra_algorithm.py

3. Run the code on your local machine.

4. Test case used for running the code:

        Start node: 5, 5
        goal node: 1150, 490 

        other test co-ordinates:
        start nodes: 10, 10
        goal node: 400, 430


5. Libraries used: OpenCV, numpy, time.
